# ProjectBeastsFury
Not the final name. Show of code on a 2D anthro fighting game with the strings of a Tekken-like game and weird terrain of DoA. 

This shown project is mostly to show any progress shown with this game. So far, I have no one else contributing to this project (this includes art assets). Anyone who may be serious to seeing this project farther than one person can go at it alone can contribute here.

PLEASE NOTE: I'm still figuring out what a GitHub is after vaguely knowing its existence for 3 years and only as of 8/24/2021 have I bothered doing something about it.
